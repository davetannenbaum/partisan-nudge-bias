### Code and data for Tannenbaum, Fox, & Rogers (2017) "On the misplaced politics of behavioral policy interventions" ###

Folders correspond to all experiments reported in the paper. Each folder contains: (1) a raw/uncleaned data file (`.csv` files); (2) a prepared/cleaned data set (`.dta` files); (3) a STATA do-file that prepares/cleans the raw data file, as well as an analysis script that executes all analyses reported in the paper (`.do` files); and (4) graph outputs (`.pdf` files).

Note: For Studies 1-3 we replace IP address information with random unique identifiers, in order to protect participant privacy. In Study 4 we surveyed a sample of US mayors, and asked them to report the approximate number of constituents they represent; we have removed this data in order to protect participant privacy.
