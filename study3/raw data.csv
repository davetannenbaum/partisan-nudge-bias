There are questions about what type of data is utilized (public sources only?), how it is extrapolated, who is extrapolating it and for what purposes.  This can be viewed as a seed change in how the U.S. views individual rights and privacy.  While I am greatly supportive of assisting low-income individuals with basics, I am also very supportive of individuals' rights to privacy...this proposal is a step towards making decisions for and about people.  For some populations this may be helpful because they may not be capable to assist themselves to the extent possible.  However for others, it is imposing or inadvertently ""labeling"" someone when they have not self-identified themselves as such.  Even by opting-out, they still have been ""identified""...or targeted if looked at for darker purposes.  History is full of examples of good intentions being executed in awful ways.  Also, by giving only one example, it skews the survey, even though it says to ignore the example.  Two or more examples should be used.  "
